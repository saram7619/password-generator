## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- CSS Grid
- Mobile-first workflow
- [React](https://reactjs.org/) - JS library
- [Typescript](https://www.typescriptlang.org) - Typescript
- [Styled Components](https://styled-components.com/) - For styles

### What I learned

- Typescript I switched from working in Reactjs to working with Typescript for this challenge. I learned a lot about working with Props, Interfaces, components and children.

- I learned to use Styled Components and webkit to build a range slider. I found it was more effective to use Styled Components instead of css styles.

### Continued development

More projects with Typescript and making media queries.

### Useful resources

- [Dave Gray ] YouTube Typescript- This helped me for Learning about the layout of components, children, interfaces and props.
- [Jack Harrington no bs ts book] - This is an amazing book which helped me finally understand Typescript. I'd recommend it to anyone still learning this concept.
